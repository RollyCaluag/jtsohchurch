                        Imagine how a simple day can unexpectedly change students’ lives as they encounter the presence of God for the first time and decided to surrender their lives to Christ. With hands raised high and eyes closed, sincerely uttering the prayer of acceptance, that’s how many of us started.
                    </p><br>

                        On an ordinary day of a typical student, right after their online classes, it’s either they’ll take a rest or spend their time playing online games with their friends. Instead of doing something else, students can now spend their free time worthwhile by attending WildSONs every Wednesday at exactly 7 PM via YouTube and Facebook Live which aims student to mold their character and deepen their relationship with the Lord.

                        WildSONs is the youth gathering of Seeds of the Nations or SONs – the youth ministry of Doulos for Christ World Harvest Ministry that focuses on one of the G12 Core Values – “The Importance of Young People.” Bishop Oriel Ballano believes in the potential of our youth today for nation transformation. This youth-oriented event provides an avenue for students to receive the right foundation as students and as sons or daughters in their family. It also creates an atmosphere where values based on biblical principles are taught through the preaching of God’s Word, so that the young people can be connected to God and used by Him while they are still in their campuses. Being wild for God means being revolutionaries, which are willing and radical to transform this nation by leading young people back to the Lord. As seeds of the nation, we should be planted on the right soil, and WildSONs provides a learning and changing experience that will make us rooted to the right foundations as individuals that will change our campus and eventually our nation.

                        We believe in the importance of the young generation, that there is always a seed of greatness that is hiding within them waiting to be revealed. From being a simple student, future businessmen, politicians, and even future presidents could be raised up. By this continuous effort, many young people are getting to know Christ as their Lord and Savior.
                    </p><br>
                    <p style="width: 65%; padding: 0px; font-size: 28px; text-align: justify; color: gray; font-family: calibri;">
                        Now, WildSONs continues to reach out the young generation of today with the same vision of bringing young people’s lives back in order by leading them to Christ.
                    </p><br>
                    <p style="width: 65%; padding: 0px; font-size: 28px; text-align: justify; color: gray; font-family: calibri;">
                        Let us all together touch other people’s lives as we drew them toward our Creator by simply initiating an act of kindness by inviting them in our WildSONs service.
